# Requirements

Being an awesome portfolio builder needs a little pre-requisites.

## Web Server

A web server is needed to deploy Brievcase. There are a lot of web servers out there that you can make use of. Those things are simple to install and easy to use. However, **you don't need a database** to make this work. Brievcase fully uses files to store the data and contents.

#### Mac OS X

By default, OS X 10.9 Mavericks already comes with built-in Apache and PHP. However, you can always install various full-stack web server such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and [MAMP/MAMP Pro.](https://www.mamp.info)

#### Windows

1. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) – A simple way to deploy a web server for Windows. This software is packaged witH Apache + PHP and MySQL, all in one.
2. [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com) – Similar to XAMPP, but the interface is different.
3. [MAMP for Windows](https://www.mamp.info) – Now available on Windows as well.

#### Linux

Linux distributions usually comes with a built-in web server. However, if it is not built-in, you can always search install one from the package manager provided along with the distribution. In order to do this, Google is very handy.

#### Apache

Brievcase works on Apache server. Using Nginx might not be helpful for this purpose.

#### PHP

Brievcase works well with PHP 5.6.30 or later.
